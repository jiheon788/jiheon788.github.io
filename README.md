- [sharadcodes/jekyll-theme-material-you](https://github.com/sharadcodes/jekyll-theme-material-you) 테마 바탕으로 제 필요에 의해 기능과 디자인을 커스텀한 블로그입니다.

## Getting started

#### Run

```
$ bundle install
```

#### Start Jekyll server

```
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

#### Access via

- localhost or according to your pc configurations.
- Change the `_config.yml` & `_data/author.yml` files as you like.
- Upload the files on your repository.

> NOTE: You have to remove `url` and `baseurl` from `_config.yml` to use this theme for `<your-username>.github.io`

#### Alert!

- Don't touch `categories.js` inside `assets/js` folder unless you know what you're doing, it is used for generating links for the particular category pill you click on.
- **Avoid having spaces in category name** because they break the category posts modal's code. You can use underscore instead of them.
